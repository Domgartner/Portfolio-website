            As a fourth-year software engineering student, I have gained a solid understanding of the fundamentals of programming. I have experience in many programming languages and have completed coursework in areas such as object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms. I have also had the opportunity to work on group and individual projects, gaining experience in version control and collaboration in a team environment.

            I am currently the intelligent systems lead at Schulich UAV, an engineering club focused on the development of an unmanned, autonomous drone. As a lead, I have been tasked with leading a team in designing and developing a machine learning algorithm for detection, classification, and localization of objects, which allows the drone to identify potential drop zones and avoidances.
